You already know parent child
from java
so just like that in css
the elements within body
inherit from it

meaning

if I applied something to the body
then all the elements within
will have it also
unless they overwrote that or something
so apply to the parents
and then override in the children

User agent styles:
btw, MOST elements inherit by default, however,
some elements are going based on the default styling
given by the browser, these are called user agent styles...

So if you want an element to inherit
and notice that it hasnt, then force it to inherit by
using the value inherit, in its css property. example below

anchor tag:
a{
    color: inherit;
}

by default anchor tags do not inherit color values in the property,
however you can specify it to inherit based on your will by typing
inherit as a value in its color property, etc.

NOTE 

Do not overwrite with px, use REM instead
its rem in all lowercase... WHy? Because

in rem r is for root

So everything in our html file is a descendant of the root tag
that is html

therefore rem usage is warranted because 

1 is a whole unit of rem and default size is  1 rem 

1.5 rem is 1.5x bigger

.5 rem is .5x smaller

rem is considered a relative unit because it is relative to another value

It is the industry standard. It works at base 16 so get used to it.

Sizes become easy because each rem set is relative to the root html's 1 rem
