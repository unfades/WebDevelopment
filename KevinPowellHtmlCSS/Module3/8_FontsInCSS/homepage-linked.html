                <h2>What's Bouldering?</h2>
                <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial 
                rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
                <p>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within 
                a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
                <p>Experience the perfect blend of physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing 
                but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, 
                making it both accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</p>
