font-family: + fontsyouwant enclosed in ' ';
    is the property for the fonts you want in your
    CSS so to make pages beautiful with fonts,
    we use that, and if one font is not working,
    then next font is gonna get used,
    its pretty much a hierarchy of fonts.

    This concept is the concept of fallbacks in terms
    of fonts.
    A bunch of these fonts are a font stack.
