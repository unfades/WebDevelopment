If ever youâ€™re working on a multi-lingual website,
logical properties offer us an easy way to ensure 
you have the right text alignment no matter what 
language the site is using.
---------------------------------------------------
So in the past people used to use
left, right, center,
but these days we use
start, end, and center
WHY? Because theres languages like
arabic and english some start
right to left others left to right
by changing the dir attribute in the
html tag, you can reorient the site
dynamically. Much better then left/right/center
therefore we use start/end/center
