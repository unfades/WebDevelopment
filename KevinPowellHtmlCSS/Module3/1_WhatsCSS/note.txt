In CSS, we write rules.

In CSS, we write rules.

The styling rules that we create are made up of 
a few different pieces:
Selector, property, and value.

-------
We need to connect our css file
we use a link tag to link the html to the css file
In the head, we mention its a stylesheet within the link tag,
rel = "stylesheet"
and also mention its location via
href = "theplacewherethecssfileisat"

like this: <link href="css/style.css" rel = "stylesheet">
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
while linking stuff....


THIS IS NOT RIGHT, A LOT OF WEBSITES DO IT BUT NAH THIS AINT RIGHT ACCORDING TO KEVIN POWELL
<p>You can head on over <a href="services.html">here</a> to learn more about our pest control services.</p>

THIS IS RIGHT, Get it now?
<p>Find out more <a href="services.html">about our pest control services</a>.</p>

------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
This is doing two things: linking our stylesheet to our
HTML file, and also telling it that it is a stylesheet, 
with the rel attribute, which is short for relationship.

You don’t need to call your CSS file style.css. 
Other common names are main.css and styles.css. 
You can call it anything you’d like, just make sure 
that you use that file name when linking it to your 
HTML file.
