Color values

When declaring a color, we can use a lot of different types of values:
    keywords
    hex codes
    rgb values
    hsl values
    and more

We're better off using hex or rgb values
etc because just plain old colors provided
they dont hit so hard do they c;

Hexcode:
As a programmer, you already know hexcode
from that codewars problem

One of the most common ways you’ll see colors declared is with hex codes, which look like this: #6a3bff.
They always start with a #, and are then followed by 6 letters or numbers.

RGB and HSL:

red green blue and also hue saturation lightness
you know this already as an artist you can tweak
to your liking c;

NOW,
The colors we’ll be using

We’ll be making some tweaks here a little bit later, but for now, we can use these colors:

    The <h1> should be #4676A9.
    The other headings are #CB731C.
    The footer uses #22466C for the background, and the text color should be #ffffff 
    (select the footer to apply these styles, and not the paragaph inside of it).


NOTE: IN CSS, ORDER MATTERS

So if you write a color property inside css twice, the last one wins

same goes for selectors

example:

p{
    background-color: green;
    background-color: black; /* It will then be black as its the last one property defined*/
}

p{
    background-color: green;
}

p{
    background-color: black;
}

/* again black wins as its the last p selector and its property val is black*/
