Typical page structure
Inside of the <body>, most pages will have a structure that looks a bit like this:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
html,head,close head
then...
like this
this is semantic html
like ordered html like how people organize stuff

<body>
  <header>
    <!-- logo + navigation -->
  </header>
  
  <main>
    <!-- the majority of the content -->
    <section> <!-- a section of content --> </section>
    <section> <!-- another section of content --> </section>
    <section> <!-- yet another --> </section>
  </main>
  
  <footer>
    <!-- copyright, sometimes another nav
         social links, contact, etc. -->
  </footer>
</body>
------------------------------------------------------
An important note about <section> elements:
I like using sections, as I find it makes things more 
clear within my own code, but they arenâ€™t required.
As we talked about already, our heading levels are what
create the structure of our content.
Proper use of heading levels is what matters, 
and sections are there more for your own organization.

Also for naming keep it all lowercase and hyphenate instead of spaces
