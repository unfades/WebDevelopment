<!-- So in html this is how we comment-->
<!--
It can both be used for single
and multiline comments I see I see...

we named it index.html because some servers are accustomed to pick up names
one of those is index.html but there's no hard and fast rule that you gotta name it index always

In vs code typing ! just exclamation and then enter will set up to paste html boilerplate code
in the past people had to write this by hand, but nowadays we don't need to write it by hand.

I generated it by typing ! then hitting enter.

<!-- This specifies that the document type is html,
before there used to be different versions, but nowadays
its just html alone

! means it is a declaration, telling the web browser the type of html being served
which in our case is just html

! then tab or enter is called Emmet Abbreviation which is boilerplate that helps us write code
faster

nobody needs to learn everything in html
but you should be able to look for the information and where to get it
in life you gotta go thru the mdn docs, w3schools, as you go just learn stuff as you go
that is the flow for your webdev
its better to learn through practice and then reference the documentation in between

<anything enclosed in this>
like
<head>
<body>
<h1>
<p>
is a tag

stuff within them are called attributes. Like this

<a href = "reddit.com"> go to reddit</a>
href is an attrribute
and so is width, height to set width and height, title is used to give a tooltip
