HTML used to be a way for this scientist Tim Lee to communicate with his scientist colleagues.
Later this was then used as a base as how the internet should communicate with each other, a
foundation for the world wide web.

The idea was that we are gonna have some tags.
Almost all of the tags are acting as containers.
For almost every tag, it starts, then ends.
<head></head>.. for heading tags
<h1></h1> for headings...
<p></p> for paragraphs.

We can assume the starting tag has an ending tag for most tags so we will just use starting tags.

<body></body> this is the body portion, this is for the body

inside a body can be headings, paragraphs, etc

<body>
    <h1>
        <p>Kinda like this I guess...</p>
    </h1>

</body>

Containers containers..

Now lets write some code.
