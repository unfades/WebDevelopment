    <h2>Here's the list of fruits!</h2>
    <!-- generated this using emmet, just by
     typing ol>li*3 and enter, this is syntax for the below ordered list
     li is a list element of it, list tags-->
    <ol> <!-- is an ordered list it is a block level element, but how can we tell?-->
        <li>apples</li> <!-- this too is a block level element we can tell by just opening
        the browser, then inspect element, then click and inspect,
        hovering over it stuff that spans whole blocks is block level element and
        stuff that is in its spot is an inline element -->
        <li>oranges</li>
        <li>pears</li><!-- ol items are numbered-->
    </ol>
    <!-- divs are just containers, they are useful to get linked to css for styling I think-->
     <div>
        <h1>Block level elements</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>h1 to h6 are block level elements</li>
                <li>ol, li</li><!--alt+shift+down to duplicate current line below-->
                <li>li</li>
                <p>p are also block level elements</p>
            </ul>
     </div>
        <h1>Inline elements</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>a tags</li>
            <li>img </li>
            <li>strong</li> <!--strong-->
            <li>em</li> <!-- emphasis-->
        </ul>

        <p><strong>strongs(anything within)</strong> are used like this. </p>
        <p><strong>instead of strong you can also use bold.</strong></p>
        <p>like <b>this!</b></p>
        <p>The difference is in the underlying html, bold is just bolding words,
            strong means you can like add importance that the part is <strong>STRONG</strong>.
        </p>
        <p><strong><em>This part is strong and I want to emphasize it too! DONE DONE.</em></strong></p>
        <p><em>ems are used like this for emphasis</em></p>
