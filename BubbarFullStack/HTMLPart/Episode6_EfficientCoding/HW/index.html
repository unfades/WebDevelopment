<!-- HW is to read MDN docs about inline and block elements 
 also in the nav in the code, how to make them become all side by side
 as rn they're all bullet points in a list,
 however how can we make it so that theres no dots nor numbers
 
 Done I used just anchor tags to make it like without bullet points 
 means no li and all in one line with a{link}*4 so I know where to put the links fast-->
