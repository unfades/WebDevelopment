Nothing in the head part was discussed nor the html etc
now we will

The head tag whatever is inside it is not visible in the head.
All visible elements in a website are in the body.

Head tags are used for SEO Search Engine Optimization

all the meta stuff is used for SEO

title tag in it updates the name in the browser when the page is opened

to have it in the title like this:

doing this: https://prnt.sc/KyF6joJT2-2s
produces this: https://prnt.sc/tCts3zOUx8KU

everything in html is styled using css
then we link it with the css file using a link tag also like for the favicon too
then we can alter that and change the elements up for that file.

also in javascript you can link the file to a script.js and put an alert in it then
link it to the html page and then you can view an alert by making it in the script.js
just like the css file but for js now.

Check the index.html code and the rest to see it in action.
