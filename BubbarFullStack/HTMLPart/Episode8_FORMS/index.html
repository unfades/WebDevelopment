<!-- Q What are forms

A Forms are structures that gather data
its a means for an input
in order for that data to be stored, processed, or used in business logic

We all know the common form login id, password, submit
That is a common form we all know of

Summary, Forms are for user input.

tags which are available
then form elements
then input elements after is the plan.

<form> tag just like the table tag,
its purpose is for making a form
for getting user input
the rest of the stuff is inside the form tag

the second tag is input tag,
ut comes in many variations
radio buttons, checkbox, date pickers,
theres lots of ways to take input using
the input tag this way.

now label tag is the third tag

means what re we supposed to input
that is the label. it tells what the data
is that e want entered, labels what to enter in.

every label has a for attribute
it needs to be completed for sure.
what goes inside the for attribute
is the input id value and thats it.

label's for and input's id must be the exact same
why? because to link those.

now e are making a little project using these tags.
in order for that data to be stored, processed, or used in business logic -->

        <!-- input tags can be of many types,

        radio for selecting circle dot entries
        checkbox for checkboxes to tick
        date for date entering 
        
        for knowing which is linked to what label, we need its 'id' attribute
        id is linked to label's 'for' attribute-->

        <input type="text" id = "myname">

        <!-- in the server, theres something listening for submit specifications,
        we can mention the type is submit in either the type = "submit" that means
        for the whole form, it is the submit button for that form...
        we can also specify this in the <form action =""> action attribute, or
        within the buttons we make-->
        
        <!-- You can also put in placeholder text with the placeholder attribute like this -->
        <br />
        <br />
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
