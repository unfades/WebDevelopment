<!--void elements-->
<!--p are not void elements because they have this content within them-->
<p>This is a paragraph</p>

<!-- elements like br(line break) and hr(horizontal rule) are void elements because arent allowed to have stuff in em-->
<!--
<hr/>
<br/>
-->

<p>Yuh paragraph1 this is paragraph 1</p>
<hr/> <!-- a horizontal line-->
<p>Yuh paragraph2 this is another paragraph</p>
<!-- br usage below first without br-->
<p>
    A poem line 1,
    A poem's second line,
    A poem's 3rd line,
    A poem's 4th line.
</p>
<!-- now with br as seen below properly with break tags-->
<p>
    A poem line 1,<br/>
    A poem's second line,<br/>
    A poem's 3rd line,<br/>
    A poem's 4th line.<br/>
</p>

<!-- Yu protip-->

<p>Don't do this!</p>

<p>
    paragraph1<br />
    paragraph2<br />
</p>

<!-- DO THIS-->

<p>paragraph1</p>
<p>paragraph2</p>

<!--Why because people with accessibility issues find it easier to get stuff read that way-->
<!--only use those breaks where needed like poem writing, addresses, formatting a specific way,
not for paragrahs!-->
